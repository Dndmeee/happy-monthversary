          Five months ago, we embarked on an incredible journey together â€” one
          filled with laughter, shared dreams, and countless beautiful moments.
          Every day has been a new page in our story, each one more special than
          the last. Youâ€™re not just a part of my story, but the most treasured
          chapter that fills my heart with joy and hope. âœ¨
        </p>
        <p className={styles.paragraph}>
          From the little things to the unforgettable adventures, every moment
          with you has shaped the person I am today. Hereâ€™s to us, and to many
          more chapters waiting to be written hand in hand.
